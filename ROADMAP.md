# CWL-Roadmap
## Rediculous plans for the future
There are not that many unimplemented plans for the future, but there
is one: We will use Blazor to make this a cross-platform web app.
## What we wanted to do, but failed
We started building a custom window framework BetterWindows, which
would set up all the C WinApi calls for creating a raw window you
can draw to, which also makes cross-platforming easier. That was
mostly replaced by the Blazor idea.
## Features we are working on
* Browser Support: importing bookmarks from Chrome (and Firefox, once
we can decode SQLite)
* Plugins
## Features we aren't working on yet
* Hotkey system
* Priority sort
